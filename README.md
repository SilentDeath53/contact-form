# Contact Form
A simple contact form.

In your HTML file, you can create a form that sends the data to the PHP script for processing (main.html). Replace the database configuration details ($host, $dbName, $username, and $password) with your own values.  You can customize the email recipient ($to) and the thank you page (thank-you.php) to your needs. Set up a mail server or use a library like PHPMailer to handle the email sending functionality.
